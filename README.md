# MlSL: Machine learning Student's Library
_Technically_ pronounced "mill-sill"; conveniently pronounced "[^missile]".

## Ethos
This library is meant to to make machine learning _as understandable as
humanly possible_; to whiten the black boxes, to make the code as good to read
as the documentation. Where it can, it holds your hand. And if it's saying too
much, you can tell it to shut up.

If there's somewhere it fails to achieve this goal, please open a
GitHub [issue](https://github.com/jad-b/mlsl/issues).

As such, it _should_ be out-performed by any of the "serious" ML packages:
Theano, Autograd, TensorFlow, etc. If not, well, something's either wrong on
their end, or I need to publish.
